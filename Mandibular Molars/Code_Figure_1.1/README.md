Before applying Algorithms 1 and 2, we performed the ECT on the raw data and normalized the polygon meshes by aligning the ECCs. The details of the ECT-based alignment procedure are given in [Wang et al. (2021)](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-15/issue-2/A-statistical-pipeline-for-identifying-physical-features-that-differentiate-classes/10.1214/20-AOAS1430.full) (particularly, Section 4 of its Supplementary Material). The aligned molars are presented in Figure 1. 
To reproduce the Figure 1, we can run the [Fig1.R](https://github.com/JinyuWang123/TDA/blob/main/Mandibular%20Molars/Code_Figure1/Fig1.R).
