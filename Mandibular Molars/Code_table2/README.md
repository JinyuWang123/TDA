Based on the [alignment_ECT](https://github.com/JinyuWang123/TDA/tree/main/Mandibular%20Molars/alignment_ECT), we can calculate the SECT. To compare any pair of mandibular molar groups, as a proof of concept, we selected the smaller size of the two groups as the sample size input $n$ in our proposed algorithms. For example, when comparing the Tarsius and Microcebus groups, we chose $n=11$; we compared the first 11 molars of the Tarsius group to all the molars in the Microcebus group. We applied Algorithms 1 and 2 to the four groups of mandibular molars and presented the results in Table 2 (e.g., [Algorithm1_Tarsius_vs_Microcebus.Rmd](https://github.com/JinyuWang123/TDA/blob/main/Mandibular%20Molars/Code_table2/Algorithm1_Tarsius_vs_Microcebus.Rmd) and [Algorithm2_Tarsius_vs_Microcebus.Rmd](https://github.com/JinyuWang123/TDA/blob/main/Mandibular%20Molars/Code_table2/Algorithm2_Tarsius_vs_Microcebus.Rmd)).

In addition to testing the difference between genera, as a proof of concept, we applied the proposed algorithms within the genus Tarsius. Specifically, we focused on the first 32 molars in the Tarsius group. We randomly split the 32 molars into two halves and applied Algorithms 1 and 2 to test the difference between the two halves (e.g., [Algorithm1_Tarsius_vs_Tarsius.Rmd](https://github.com/JinyuWang123/TDA/blob/main/Mandibular%20Molars/Code_table2/Algorithm1_Tarsius_vs_Tarsius.Rmd) and [Algorithm2_Tarsius_vs_Tarsius.Rmd](https://github.com/JinyuWang123/TDA/blob/main/Mandibular%20Molars/Code_table2/Algorithm2_Tarsius_vs_Tarsius.Rmd)). We repeated the random splitting procedure 100 times and presented the corresponding p-values in the last row of Table 2.
