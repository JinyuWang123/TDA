We firstly computes the dictionary between given O(3) actions (posECTmiscdata/grid) and permutations of directions (posECTmiscdata/directions). The details of the ECT-based alignment procedure are given in [Wang et al. (2021)](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-15/issue-2/A-statistical-pipeline-for-identifying-physical-features-that-differentiate-classes/10.1214/20-AOAS1430.full). Computing this dictionary is computationally expensive. For convenience, the dictionary has been computed and stored in directory /res. This dictionary consists of 16,000 O(3) actions and 2,918 directions.
