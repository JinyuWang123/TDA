We firstly computes the dictionary between given O(3) actions (posECTmiscdata/grid) and permutations of directions (posECTmiscdata/directions). The details of the ECT-based alignment procedure are given in [Wang et al. (2021)](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-15/issue-2/A-statistical-pipeline-for-identifying-physical-features-that-differentiate-classes/10.1214/20-AOAS1430.full). Computing this dictionary is computationally expensive. For convenience, the dictionary has been computed and stored in res. This dictionary consists of 16,000 O(3) actions and 2,918 directions.

However, due to GitHub file size limitations, the dictionary file here is not complete. For the full file, please visit the [following link.](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rs8pjmhrwcdcuxk/AABEjsJIFGGFvxcG5Z9kzApqa/ECT_alignment_demo?dl=0&subfolder_nav_tracking=1)
