# Randomness and Statistical Inference of Shapes via the Smooth Euler Characteristic Transform
We provide the foundations for deriving the distributions of smooth Euler characteristic transform. Based on these foundations and motivated by functional data analysis, we propose two algorithms for testing hypotheses on random shapes. Simulation studies are provided to support our mathematical derivations and show the performance of our hypothesis testing framework. We apply our proposed algorithms to analyze a data set of mandibular molars from four genera of primates to test for shape differences and interpret the corresponding results from the morphology viewpoint.

Results in the manuscript were derived by using the R version of the code. Based on the structure of the manuscript, this repositories is divided into three parts:
1. Simulation Study (Section 5 of the manuscript)
2. Silhouette Database (Section 6.1 of the manuscript)
3. Mandibular Molars (Section 6.2 of the manuscript)
