Based on the calculated [ECT](https://github.com/JinyuWang123/TDA/blob/main/Silhouette%20Database/Data/MRIECs.RData), we can calculate the SECT. And then We applied Algorithms 1 and Algorithms 2 to the three classes of shapes to test the null hypothesis that the shapes are different between the pairs of groups and presented the results in Table 2 (e.g., [Algorithm1_Apple_vs_Child.Rmd](https://github.com/JinyuWang123/TDA/blob/main/Silhouette%20Database/Code_table3/Algorithm1_Apple_vs_Child.Rmd) and [Algorithm2_Apple_vs_Child.Rmd](https://github.com/JinyuWang123/TDA/blob/main/Silhouette%20Database/Code_table3/Algorithm2_Apple_vs_Child.Rmd)).

In addition to testing the difference between shape classes, we applied the algorithms within each shape class. Specifically, for each shape class, we randomly split the class into two halves and applied the algorithms to test the difference between the two halves. We repeated the random splitting procedure 100 times and presented the corresponding p-values in Table 2 (rows 4-6) (e.g., [Algorithm1_Apple_vs_Apple.Rmd](https://github.com/JinyuWang123/TDA/blob/main/Silhouette%20Database/Code_table3/Algorithm1_Apple_vs_Apple.Rmd) and [Algorithm2_Apple_vs_Apple.Rmd](https://github.com/JinyuWang123/TDA/blob/main/Silhouette%20Database/Code_table3/Algorithm2_Apple_vs_Apple.Rmd)).
