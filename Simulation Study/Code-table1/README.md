## Organization
Running the code to calculate the rejection rates of Algorithms 1, 2, and 3 across different indices $\varepsilon\in$ \{0, 0.0125, 0.025, 0.0375, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1\} (significance $\alpha = 0.05$).


For example, Running our_type1.R produces the result of rejection rates of Algorithm 1($\varepsilon$ = 0).

Running our_type1.R produces the result of rejection rates of Algorithm 2($\varepsilon$ = 0).

Running our_type1.R produces the result of rejection rates of Algorithm 3($\varepsilon$ = 0).

### If you want to calculate the rejection rates of the algorithms at different epsilon values, you only need to change the epsilon value in the part of the code that reads: 

### "# The parameter determining the distribution P^{(epsilon)} 
### epsilon=0"."
