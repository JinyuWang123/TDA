## Organization
Running the code to calculate the rejection rates of Algorithms 1, 2, and 3 across different indices $\varepsilon\in$ \{0, 0.0125, 0.025, 0.0375, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1\} (significance $\alpha = 0.05$).


For example, Running our_type1.R produces the result of rejection rates of Algorithm 1($\varepsilon$ = 0).
